# Boundary-Estimation-and-MPCC

This repository contains all the code needed for our thesis paper Boundary Estimation and Model Predictive Contouring Control: Implementation for a Formula Student Race Car.

### Installation

In order to be able to run the code, the following need to be installed:

* ROS middleware - https://www.ros.org/install/ (melodic was used during implementation)
* OpEn framework - https://alphaville.github.io/optimization-engine/docs/installation

### Running

Before running the code, all absolute paths involved in the ROS package need to be renamed to the user's ones. This can simply be done by running `./update_homedir nameOfPreviousUser`, which replaces the name of the user who pushed the most recent commit by the current user's name. (The most recent commit of this version is done by *wouter*.)



More information specific to both the Python and the C++ code can be found in their corresponding readme files.
